      <h3>
        The I-beam pointer (also called the I-cursor) is a cursor shaped like a
        <a href="/wiki/Serif" title="Serif">serifed</a> capital letter "I". The purpose of this cursor is to
        indicate that the text beneath the cursor can be highlighted, and sometimes inserted or changed.<sup

          The pointer <i>hotspot</i> is the active pixel of the pointer, used to target a
          <a href="/wiki/Point_and_click" title="Point and click">click</a> or
          <a href="/wiki/Drag_and_drop" title="Drag and drop">drag</a>. The hotspot is normally along the pointer
          edges or in its center, though it may reside at any location in the pointer.<sup id="cite_ref-9"

          In many GUIs, moving the pointer around the screen may reveal other
          <a href="/wiki/Screen_hotspot" title="Screen hotspot">screen hotspots</a> as the pointer changes shape
          depending on the circumstances. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In text that the user can
            <a href="/wiki/Selection_(user_interface)" title="Selection (user interface)">select</a> or edit, the
            pointer changes to a vertical bar with little cross-bars (or curved
            <a href="/wiki/Serif" title="Serif">serif</a>-like extensions) at the top and bottom â€” sometimes called an
            "<a href="/wiki/I-beam" title="I-beam">I-beam</a>" since it resembles the cross-section of the
            construction detail of the same name.
          </li>
          <li>
            When displaying a document, the pointer can appear as a hand with all fingers extended allowing scrolling
            by "pushing" the displayed page around.
          </li>
          <li>
            Graphics-editing pointers such as brushes, pencils or paint buckets may display when the user edits an
            image.
          </li>
          <li>
            On an edge or corner of a <a href="/wiki/Window_(computing)" title="Window (computing)">window</a> the
            pointer usually changes into a double arrow (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) indicating that the user
            can drag the edge/corner in an indicated direction in order to adjust the size and shape of the window.
          </li>
          <li>
            The corners and edges of the whole screen may also act as hotspots. According to
            <a href="/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" title="Fitts's law">Fitts's law</a>, which predicts the time it takes to
            reach a target area, moving mouse and stylus pointers to those spots is easy and fast. As the pointer
            usually stops when reaching a screen edge, the size of those spots can be considered of virtual infinite
            size, so the hot corners and edges can be reached quickly by throwing the pointer toward the edges.<sup

            While a computer process is performing tasks and cannot accept user input, a wait pointer (an
            <a href="/wiki/Hourglass" title="Hourglass">hourglass</a> in
            <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> before

            <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> and later, watch in
            <a href="/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS" title="Classic Mac OS">classic Mac OS</a>, or
            <a href="/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel" title="Spinning pinwheel">spinning pinwheel</a> in macOS) is displayed
            when the mouse pointer is in the corresponding window.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the pointer hovers over a <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink" title="Hyperlink">hyperlink</a>, a
            <a href="/wiki/Mouseover" title="Mouseover">mouseover</a> event changes the pointer into a hand with an
            outstretched index finger. Often some informative text about the link may pop up in a
            <a href="/wiki/Tooltip" title="Tooltip">tooltip</a>, which disappears when the user moves the pointer
            away. The tooltips revealed in the box depend on the implementation of the
            <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browser</a>; many web browsers will display the
            "title" of the element, the "alt" attribute, or the non-<a href="/wiki/Web_standard" class="mw-redirect"
              title="Web standard">standard</a>
            "tooltips" attribute. This pointer shape was first used for hyperlinks in Apple Computer's
            <a href="/wiki/HyperCard" title="HyperCard">HyperCard</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <a href="/wiki/Windows_7" title="Windows 7">Windows 7</a>, when Windows Touch was introduced in the
            mainstream to make Windows more touch friendly, a touch pointer is displayed instead of the mouse pointer.
            The touch pointer can be switched off in Control Panel and resembles a small diamond shape. When the
            screen is touched a blue ripple appears around the touch pointer to provide visual touch feedback. When
            swiping to scroll etc., the touch pointer would follow the finger as it moves. If touch and hold to right
            click is enabled, touching and holding will show a thick white ring around the touch pointer. When this
            ring appears, releasing one's finger would perform a right click.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a pen is used the left-click ripple is colourless instead of blue and the right-click ring is a
                thinner ring which appears closer to the pen tip making contact with the screen. A click (either left
                or right) will not show the touch pointer, but swiping would still show the pointer which would follow
                the pen tip.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also, the touch pointer would only appear on the desktop once a user has signed in to Windows 7. On
                the sign in screen the mouse cursor would simply jump to the point which is touched and a left click
                would be sent on a tap, similarly to when touch input is used on operating systems prior to Windows 7.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            In <a href="/wiki/Windows_8" title="Windows 8">Windows 8</a> and above, visual touch feedback displays a
            translucent circle where the finger makes contact with the screen, and a square when attempting to touch
            and hold to right-click. A swipe is shown by a translucent line of varying thickness. Feedback can be
            switched on and off in Pen and Touch settings of the
            <a href="/wiki/Control_Panel_(Windows)" title="Control Panel (Windows)">Control Panel</a> in
            <a href="/wiki/Windows_8" title="Windows 8">Windows 8</a> and
            <a href="/wiki/Windows_8.1" title="Windows 8.1">Windows 8.1</a> or in the
            <a href="/wiki/Settings_(Windows)" title="Settings (Windows)">Settings</a> app on
            <a href="/wiki/Windows_10" title="Windows 10">Windows 10</a>, and feedback can also be made darker and
            larger where it needs to be emphasised, such as when presenting. However, the touch pointer is normally
            less commonly visible in touchscreen environments of Windows operating systems later than Windows 7.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mouse-over or hover gesture can also show a <a href="/wiki/Tooltip" title="Tooltip">tooltip</a>, which
            presents information about what the pointer is hovering over; the information is a description of what
            selecting an active element is for or what it will do. The tooltip appears only when stationary over
            content. A common use of viewing the information is when browsing the internet to know the destination of
            a <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink" title="Hyperlink">link</a> before selecting it, if the
            <a href="/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" class="mw-redirect" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</a> of
            the text is not recognisable.
            <ul>
              <li>
                When using touch or a pen with Windows, hovering when supported or performing a set gesture or flick
                may show the tooltip
