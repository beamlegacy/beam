# Beam
## ⚠️ Open Sourcing in progress ⚠️ 

The official development of **beam** macOS app [has stopped in November 2022](https://twitter.com/getonbeam/status/1592134355371331585)

Because the app is still used by some of us, and we still believe in a webkit-based ML-powered browser + note editor. We decided to open source it.

This is still far from done, please reach out if you want to contribute [TBD]


## Running the project

For now we're focusing on making the project run in debug, locally from Xcode.

### How to run
* Clone this repo
* `cd` inside the project and run: `make setup`



## Running the tests

TBD - Checkout README_previous.md to see old instructions.


## Developing new features

TBD - The process

### Creating a new Web component with build step
Run `yarn generate` to use the CLI wizard to generate a TS component.


### Credits

TBD
