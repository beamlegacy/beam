## 🚀 Getting Started 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The official development of **beam** macOS app [has stopped in November 2022](https://twitter.com/getonbeam/status/1592134355371331585). Because the app is still used by some of us, and we still believe in a webkit-based ML-powered browser + note editor. We decided to open source it. This is still far from done, please reach out if you want to contribute [TBD]

Pull Requests with bug fixes and new features are much appreciated. We will be happy to review them and merge it once ready. While the official development of **beam** macOS app [has stopped in November 2022](https://twitter.com/getonbeam/status/1592134355371331585) the app is still used my some of us.
